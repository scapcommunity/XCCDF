# XCCDF Data Model

## Introduction

The XCCDF data model and its XML representation are intended to be
platform-independent and portable to foster broad adoption and sharing
of rules. The fundamental data model for XCCDF consists of the following
main element data types:

-   **Benchmark.** An XCCDF benchmark document holds an
    > *\<xccdf:Benchmark\>* element, which acts as a container for other
    > elements, including *\<xccdf:Group\>*, *\<xccdf:Rule\>*,
    > *\<xccdf:Value\>*, *\<xccdf:Profile\>,* and *\<xccdf:TestResult\>*
    > elements.

-   **Item.** An item is a named constituent of an
    > *\<xccdf:Benchmark\>*. There are three types of items:

    -   **Group.** An *\<xccdf:Group\>* holds other items. An
        > *\<xccdf:Group\>* collects related *\<xccdf:Rule\>* and
        > *\<xccdf:Value\>* elements into a common structure and can
        > provide descriptive text and references about them. An
        > *\<xccdf:Group\>* allows benchmark users to select and
        > deselect related *\<xccdf:Rule\>* elements together; since a
        > deselected *\<xccdf:Group\>* is not processed, none of its
        > contained items are processed either. Selection of an
        > *\<xccdf:Group\>* allows its children to be processed normally
        > based on their individual selection states.

    -   **Rule.** An *\<xccdf:Rule\>* element holds check references and
        > can also hold remediation information.

    -   **Value.** An *\<xccdf:Value\>* element is a named data value
        > that can be substituted into other items' properties or into
        > checks. It can have an associated data type and metadata that
        > express how the value should be used and how it can be
        > tailored.

<!-- -->

-   **Profile.** An *\<xccdf:Profile\>* element is a named tailoring of
    > a benchmark using a collection of attributed references to
    > *\<xccdf:Rule\>*, *\<xccdf:Group\>*, and *\<xccdf:Value\>*
    > elements. It allows definition of named levels or baselines in a
    > benchmark (see Section 5.2).

-   **TestResult.** An *\<xccdf:TestResult\>* element holds the results
    > of performing a test or check against a single target device or
    > system. An *\<xccdf:TestResult\>* element references
    > *\<xccdf:Rule\>* and *\<xccdf:Value\>* elements and may also
    > reference an *\<xccdf:Profile\>* element.

-   **Tailoring.** A tailoring document holds exactly one
    > *\<xccdf:Tailoring*\> element, which contains *\<xccdf:Profile\>*
    > elements to modify the behavior of an *\<xccdf:Benchmark\>*.

The rest of this section explains the relationships between these main
element data types and examines each of the types in more detail.
Section 6.2 discusses general information that applies to most or all of
the main element data types. Sections 6.3 through 6.7 cover
*\<xccdf:Benchmark\>*, item (*\<xccdf:Group\>*, *\<xccdf:Rule\>*,
*\<xccdf:Value\>*), *\<xccdf:Profile\>*, *\<xccdf:TestResult\>*, and
*\<xccdf:Tailoring\>* elements, respectively.

## General XML Information

### XCCDF Namespace and XML Schema

The namespace URI for this specification shall be
"http://checklists.nist.gov/xccdf/1.2". Applications that process XCCDF
should use the namespace URI to decide whether or not they can process a
given document. The XML representation of XCCDF is expressed as an XML
schema at <http://scap.nist.gov/specifications/xccdf/#resource-1.2>. The
XML schema implementation of XCCDF shall be the authoritative XML
binding definition for XCCDF.

### Element and Attribute Formatting

The structure of an XCCDF document supports transformation into HTML and
various XML formats to promote portability and interoperability. The
XCCDF language also allows for the inclusion of content that does not
contribute directly to the technical content, such as an introduction, a
rationale, warnings, and external references. XCCDF also provides
mechanisms to document authors for formatting text, including images,
and referencing other information resources (e.g., prose publications),
but these mechanisms are separable from the text itself so they can be
filtered out by applications that do not support or require them.

Throughout the rest of this section, there are tables that show the
possible properties of each main element in the XCCDF data model. In the
tables, properties of type "identifier" must be strings obeying the
definition of "NCName" from \[XMLSCHEMA\]. Properties of type "string"
and "text" must not include XHTML formatting. Properties of type
"HTML-enabled text" are string data that may include embedded
formatting, presentation, and hyperlink structure; if present, these
must be expressed using Extensible Hypertext Markup Language (XHTML)
Basic tags \[XHTML\]. The core modules noted in \[XHTML\] and the
Presentation module may be used for this.

XHTML markup allows authors to specify how the content of certain fields
should be displayed to a user. However, while this allows authors to
specify every detail of a field\'s display, authors may use classifiers
in these fields, using class attributes in \<div\> or \<span\> elements.
These tell products the type of content contained within a text block
and allow the products to display this content according to their own
conventions. Authors may wish to do this so their content fits better
with other automated formatting choices made by a product or a
stylesheet, and also because some products may not support the complete
range of HTML tags in their displays, thus causing some explicit
formatting to be ignored. A list of recommended class values appears in
Table 2. Authors may use class values not included in this list, and it
is optional for products to have special formatting for any of the
listed classifiers. However, both authors and products should use these
class designators when appropriate to provide more effective display of
content. Use of these class attribute values shall be applicable
wherever HTML content can be included in XCCDF documents.

[]{#_Ref294715794 .anchor}Table : Recommended Class Values

  -------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Class Value    Meaning
  license        Licensing and use information
  copyright      Copyright and ownership information
  tangent        A block of text that contains tangentially related information (possibly appropriate for inclusion as a sidebar or a pop-up)
  warning        Pitfalls or cautions relative to the surrounding text. High-level and general warnings should appear in designated warning fields, if available.
  critical       Content of critical importance to the user
  example        An example of some kind
  instructions   Special instructions to the user
  default        General information. Empty or absent class attributes also imply \"default\" appearance. This tag allows authors to explicitly indicate that text should appear in the default format.
  -------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Element Identifiers

The elements listed in Table 3 have special conventions around the
format of their identifiers (*\@id* attribute). Authors MUST follow
these conventions because they make it easier to preserve the global
uniqueness of the resulting identifiers.

[]{#_Ref297105058 .anchor}Table : Element Identifier Format Conventions

  Element      Format Convention
  ------------ ----------------------------------------
  Benchmark    xccdf\_*namespace*\_benchmark\_*name*
  Profile      xccdf\_*namespace*\_profile\_*name*
  Group        xccdf\_*namespace*\_group\_*name*
  Rule         xccdf\_*namespace*\_rule\_*name*
  Value        xccdf\_*namespace*\_value\_*name*
  TestResult   xccdf\_*namespace*\_testresult\_*name*
  Tailoring    xccdf\_*namespace*\_tailoring\_*name*

In Table 3, *namespace* contains a valid reverse-DNS style string
(limited to letters, numbers, periods, and the hyphen character) that is
associated with the content author. Examples include
\"com.acme.finance\" and \"gov.tla\". These *namespace* strings may have
any number of parts, and benchmark consumers processing them SHALL treat
them as case-insensitive. (That is, com.ABC is considered identical to
com.abc.) This association with the content author is solely to ensure
that different content authors will not use the same namespace value, as
this could lead to identifier collisions. Readers should not
automatically infer any special authority or trust of the content based
on the namespace since reuse of the element or changes to referenced
content may not align with the author\'s original intent. The *name*
component in the format conventions may be any NCName-compliant string
\[XMLSCHEMA\]. Identifier fields other than those noted in Table 3 have
no additional formatting conventions beyond compliance with the NCName
data type.

See the example *\<xccdf:Profile\>* in Section 6.5.1 for several
examples of the element identifier format conventions.

### \<xccdf:metadata\> Element

XCCDF supports inclusion of metadata about a document, including title,
name of author(s), organization providing the guidance, version number,
release date, update URL, and a description. This is particularly useful
for facilitating the discovery and retrieval of XCCDF checklists from
public repositories.

When used, the *\<xccdf:metadata\>* element shall contain document
metadata expressed in XML. The metadata element can appear one or more
times as a child of the *\<xccdf:Benchmark\>*, *\<xccdf:Rule\>*,
*\<xccdf:Group\>*, *\<xccdf:Value\>*, *\<xccdf:Profile\>*,
*\<xccdf:TestResult\>*, *\<xccdf:rule-result\>*, and
*\<xccdf:Tailoring\>* elements. The *\<xccdf:Benchmark\>* element SHOULD
contain metadata information formatted using the Dublin Core Metadata
Initiative (DCMI) Simple DC Element specification, as described in
\[DCES\] and \[DCXML\]. Benchmark consumers should be prepared to
process Dublin Core metadata in the *\<xccdf:metadata\>* element. An
example of the Dublin Core format is shown below.

+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
| \<xccdf:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"\>  |
|                                                                   |
| \<dc:title\>Security Benchmark for Ethernet Hubs\</dc:title\>     |
|                                                                   |
| \<dc:creator\>James Smith\</dc:creator\>                          |
|                                                                   |
| \<dc:publisher\>Center for Internet Security\</dc:publisher\>     |
|                                                                   |
| \<dc:subject\>network security for layer 2 devices\</dc:subject\> |
|                                                                   |
| \</xccdf:metadata\>                                               |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------+

Elements that support the *\<xccdf:metadata\>* element MAY use any
desired metadata format; for *\<xccdf:Benchmark\>*, this is in addition
to the Dublin Core recommendations already mentioned. Any XML metadata
structures, including ad hoc structures, may be included in an
*\<xccdf:metadata\>* element. Because any structures can appear in this
field, authors should tag metadata with the *xmlns* prefix \[XMLNAME\]
and, if available, the *\@xsi:schemaLocation* attribute in order to
identify the metadata structure utilized. Metadata should comply with
existing commercial or government metadata specifications to allow
benchmarks to be discovered and indexed.

Metadata is a powerful feature for authors. However, XCCDF puts some
limits on the use of metadata:

-   Metadata should not replace the functionality of existing fields
    within XCCDF. If the information matches the common use of some
    other XCCDF field, the information must appear in that XCCDF field.
    It MAY also appear in the *\<xccdf:metadata\>* element.

-   Metadata shall not change the processing model as outlined in
    Section 7. Benchmark consumer products shall perform XCCDF
    assessments in the same way regardless of the presence of metadata.
    Metadata may still be used to support assessment features that are
    outside the purview of XCCDF---for example, to hold post-processing
    instructions to be performed on the completed XCCDF results or to
    display additional information to the user before or during the
    assessment.

-   Metadata SHOULD not alter the character content of the XCCDF
    properties used to generate output during document generation.
    Contents of the *\<xccdf:metadata\>* element MAY be added to the
    output above and beyond the XCCDF properties. Metadata may contain
    instructions that cause different stylistic conventions to be
    adopted in the conversion of an XCCDF document to prose.

### Platform Names

The Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) specification allows a specific
hardware or software platform to be identified by a unique name. CPE
names can express only single platforms (e.g.,
\"cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows\_xp:\*:gold:professional:\*:\*:\*:\*:\*\"
for Microsoft Windows XP Professional Edition). CPE applicability
language statements can express complex logical constructions of CPE
names.

*\<xccdf:Benchmark\>*, *\<xccdf:Profile\>,* *\<xccdf:Rule\>*, and
*\<xccdf:Group\>* elements may be qualified by applicable platform using
the *\<xccdf:platform\>* element. *\<xccdf:TestResult\>* elements may
also include *\<xccdf:platform\>* elements. The *\<xccdf:platform\>*
element's *\@idref* attribute may hold a reference to either a CPE name
or the *\@id* attribute of a CPE applicability language expression that
SHALL be defined as a child of the *\<xccdf:Benchmark\>* using a
*\<cpe2:platform-specification\>* element (see Table 4). (The syntax for
referring to a local CPE applicability language identifier SHOULD be a
"\#" character before the identifier, such as "\#cpeid1".)

Within XCCDF documents, all CPE names SHALL comply with the CPE 2.3
Naming specification \[IR7695\], and all CPE applicability language
expressions SHALL comply with the CPE 2.3 Applicability Language
specification \[IR7698\]. CPE 2.0 names MAY be used for backwards
compatibility, but their use has been deprecated for XCCDF 1.2. All CPE
2.3 names and applicability language expressions in XCCDF documents
SHOULD use formatted string bindings but MAY use URI bindings instead,
both as defined in \[IR7695\].

Here is an example of a *\<cpe2:platform-specification\>* element:

```xml
<cpe2:platform-specification>
  <cpe2:platform id="xp_and_acrobat_9.0">
    <cpe2:logical-test operator="AND" negate="false">
      <cpe2:fact-ref
         name="cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows_xp:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"/>
      <cpe2:fact-ref
         name="cpe:2.3:a:adobe:acrobat:9.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"/>
    </cpe2:logical-test>
   </cpe2:platform>
</cpe2:platform-specification>
<xccdf:platform idref="#xp_and_acrobat_9.0"/>
```

If an *\<xccdf:Profile\>,* *\<xccdf:Rule\>*, or *\<xccdf:Group\>* does
not possess any *\<xccdf:platform\>* elements, then it shall apply to
the same set of platforms as its nearest enclosing ancestor
*\<xccdf:Group\>* or *\<xccdf:Benchmark\>*. If the enclosing ancestor
has no *\<xccdf:platform\>* element, then consult the next enclosing
ancestor, repeating until either an ancestor has an *\<xccdf:platform\>*
element or the *\<xccdf:Benchmark\>* element is reached. If no ancestor,
including the *\<xccdf:Benchmark\>* element, possesses any
*\<xccdf:platform\>* elements, then the *\<xccdf:Profile\>,*
*\<xccdf:Rule\>*, or *\<xccdf:Group\>* shall nominally apply to all
platforms.

### \<xccdf:reference\> Element

The *\<xccdf:reference\>* element provides a reference to a document or
resource where the user can learn more about the subject of the parent
element. It may be included within *\<xccdf:Benchmark\>*,
*\<xccdf:Rule\>*, *\<xccdf:Group\>*, *\<xccdf:Value\>*, and
*\<xccdf:Profile\>* elements. When used, it SHALL have either a simple
string value or a value consisting of simple Dublin Core elements as
described in \[DCXML\]. It MAY also have an *\@href* attribute that
gives a URL for the referenced resource. References SHOULD be given as
Dublin Core descriptions; a bare string may be used for simplicity. If a
bare string appears, then it is taken to be the string content for a
*\<dc:title\>* element. For more information, consult \[DCES\]. Multiple
*\<xccdf:reference\>* elements may appear; a benchmark consumer product
MAY concatenate them or put them into a reference list, and MAY choose
to number them.

### \<xccdf:signature\> Element

XCCDF supports a digital signature mechanism whereby XCCDF document
users can validate the integrity, origin, and authenticity of documents.
XCCDF provides a means to hold such signatures and a uniform method for
applying and validating them \[XMLDSIG\].

The *\<xccdf:signature\>* element may hold an enveloped digital
signature asserting authorship and allowing verification of the
integrity of associated data (e.g., its parent element, other documents,
portions of other documents). The signature shall apply only after
inclusion (i.e., XInclude) processing. The *\<xccdf:signature\>* element
is optional, and it may appear as a child of the *\<xccdf:Benchmark\>*,
*\<xccdf:Rule\>*, *\<xccdf:Group\>*, *\<xccdf:Value\>*,
*\<xccdf:Profile\>*, *\<xccdf:TestResult\>*, or *\<xccdf:Tailoring\>*
elements.

Any digital signature format employed for XCCDF must be capable of
identifying the signer, storing all information needed to verify the
signature (usually a certificate or certificate chain), and detecting
any change to the signed content. XCCDF products that support signatures
must support the W3C XML-Signature standard enveloped signatures, as
defined in \[XMLDSIG\].

If multiple signatures are needed in an XCCDF document, at most one of
them MAY be enveloped; all others must be detached \[XMLDSIG Section
2\].

The single child element of the *\<xccdf:signature\>* element should be
*\<dsig:Signature\>* and that *\<dsig:Signature\>* should contain one or
more *\<dsig:Reference\>* elements indicating each XML element to be
included in the signature. The *\<dsig:Reference\>* URI should be a
relative URI to the *\@Id* attribute value of the enclosing object
(prefixed by "\#"). For example, if the Id="abc", then the
*\<Reference\>* URI would be "\#abc".

### Status Tracking

XCCDF provides two elements for status tracking: *\<xccdf:status\>* and
*\<xccdf:dc-status\>*. Both elements are available for
*\<xccdf:Benchmark\>*, *\<xccdf:Rule\>*, *\<xccdf:Group\>*,
*\<xccdf:Value\>*, *\<xccdf:Profile\>*, and *\<xccdf:Tailoring\>*
elements.

The intent of the *\<xccdf:status\>* element is to record the maturity
or consensus level for its parent element. Permissible values are
"incomplete" (under initial development), "draft" (released in draft
state), "interim" (revised and in the process of being finalized),
"accepted" (released as final), and "deprecated" (no longer needed). If
there is more than one *\<xccdf:status\>* element for a single parent
element, then every instance of the *\<xccdf:status\>* element MUST have
a date attribute, and the *\<xccdf:status\>* element with the latest
date shall be considered the latest status.

The *\<xccdf:dc-status\>* element holds additional status information
using the Dublin Core format, expressed as elements of the DCMI Simple
DC Element specification, as described in \[DCES\] and \[DCXML\].

### Text Substitution

XCCDF provides capabilities to perform substitution within certain
properties of an *\<xccdf:Benchmark\>*.

An *\<xccdf:plain-text\>* element is a reusable text block for reference
by the *\<xccdf:sub\>* element. This allows text to be defined once and
then reused multiple times. Each *\<xccdf:plain-text\>* element MUST
have a unique NCName identifier. The identifiers for
*\<xccdf:plain-text\>* MUST NOT collide with item identifiers within the
*\<xccdf:Benchmark\>*.

The *\<xccdf:sub\>* element represents a reference to a parameter value
that may be set during tailoring. The *\<xccdf:sub\>* element is
supported by several elements, which are noted as they are defined
throughout the rest of this section. The *\<xccdf:sub\>* element shall
not have any content. It must have a single *\@idref* attribute, which
must equal the *\@id* attribute of an *\<xccdf:Value\>* element or an
*\<xccdf:plain-text\>* element. During document generation, each
instance of the *\<xccdf:sub\>* element will be replaced by the text
value of the referenced element's contents. If an *\<xccdf:Value\>*
element is referenced, the *\<xccdf:sub\>* element MAY have a *\@use*
attribute that indicates whether the *\<xccdf:Value\>* element\'s title
or value should replace the *\<xccdf:sub\>* element. If an
*\<xccdf:plain-text\>* element is referenced, the *\@use* attribute is
ignored and the body of the *\<xccdf:plain-text\>* element is always
used in the substitution.

See Section 7.2.3.6.3 for additional requirements related to
substitution processing.

### \@xml:lang Attribute

Some textual elements of XCCDF, such as titles and descriptions, support
the *\@xml:lang* attribute to denote the language they use.[^1] Elements
that have an *\@xml:lang* attribute may appear multiple times within a
single parent element to support multiple languages. If there are
multiple instances of such a textual element within a single parent
element, each instance SHOULD have a value for its *\@xml:lang*
attribute. Each value SHOULD specify the natural language locale for
which the instance is written (e.g., "en" for English, "fr" for French).
Values SHOULD be valid language tags as defined by \[RFC5646\]. Although
any valid language tag MAY be used, only tags containing language codes
(with or without region codes) SHOULD be used. All language and region
codes used SHOULD be in the *Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)
Language Subtag Registry* \[ILSR\]. An example of using the *\@xml:lang*
attribute is shown below.

```xml
<xccdf:Value id="xccdf_org.example_value\web-server-port" type="number">
   <xccdf:title xml:lang="en">Web Server Port</xccdf:title>
   <xccdf:title xml:lang="fr">Le Port Du Web Serveur</xccdf:title>
   <xccdf:question xml:lang="en">
      What is the web server's TCP port?
   </xccdf:question>
   <xccdf:question xml:lang="fr">
      Quel est le port du TCP du web serveur?
   </xccdf:question>
   <xccdf:value>80</xccdf:value>
</xccdf:Value>
```

If an element other than *\<xccdf:Benchmark\>* that supports the
*\@xml:lang* attribute omits it, the *\@xml:lang* attribute of the
nearest ancestor element that has the *\@xml:lang* attribute SHALL be
consulted.

## \<xccdf:Benchmark\>

### Basics

Each XCCDF benchmark document SHALL consist of a single root
*\<xccdf:Benchmark\>* element, which encloses the entire benchmark. The
example below illustrates the outermost structure of an XCCDF XML
document.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<xccdf:Benchmark id="xccdf_org.example_benchmark_example1" xml:lang="en" Id="toSign"
      xmlns:htm="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"

  <xccdf:reference href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc822.txt">
      Standard for the Format of ARPA Internet Text Messages
  </xccdf:reference>
</xccdf:Benchmark>
```

Figure 1 illustrates a typical internal structure for a Benchmark.

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ![Diagram of XCCDF object nesting: Benchmark contains Profiles, Values and Groups. Groups contain Values, Groups, and Rules.](media/image3.wmf){width="6.5in" height="2.9166666666666665in"}
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[]{#_Ref294716197 .anchor}Figure : Typical Structure of a Benchmark

The possible inheritance relations between Rule and Value instances are
constrained by the tree structure of the Benchmark. All extension
relationships must be resolved before the Benchmark can be applied. An
item may only extend another item of the same type that is visible from
its scope. In other words, an item Y may extend a base item X, as long
as they are the same type and one of the following visibility conditions
holds:

-   X is a direct child of the Benchmark.

-   X is a direct child of a Group which is also an ancestor[^2] of Y.

-   X is a direct child of a Group which is extended by any ancestor
    of Y.

For example, in the Benchmark structure shown in Figure 1, it would be
legal for Rule (g) to extend Rule (f) or extend Rule (h). It would not
be legal for Rule (i) to extend Rule (m), because (m) is not visible
from the scope of (i). It would not be legal for Rule (l) to extend
Value (k), because they are not of the same type.

The ability for an item to be extended gives benchmark authors the
ability to create variations or specialized versions of items without
making copies. An extending item can inherit properties from the
extended (base item) and sometimes can override properties with new
values if needed; however, there are several restrictions on these
inheritance capabilities. For example, some properties have different
inheritance behaviors depending on how their *\@override* attribute is
set. Also, group extension has been deprecated as of XCCDF 1.2 (see
Table 42) and authors are strongly discouraged from using it due to the
risks it poses to interoperability. See Section 7.2.2 for more
information on inheritance.

Circular dependencies caused by extension MUST not be defined.

### Properties

Table 4 describes the *\<xccdf:Benchmark\>* element's properties.

In this table and in similar tables throughout the rest of the section,
the Count column indicates how many times each property shall be
permitted within a single instance of the parent element. Each Count is
expressed as either a single value or a range of values. If the Count
entry for a property includes the value 0, the property is optional,
otherwise the property is required. If the Count entry for a property
includes the value n, the property MAY be used more than one time, with
no upper bound. Here are some examples:

-   1: the property shall be used once

-   1-n: the property shall be used at least once and may be used more
    than once

-   0-1: the property is optional and may be used at most once

-   0-n: the property is optional and may be used more than once

The properties that comprise an *\<xccdf:Benchmark\>* or items are an
ordered sequence of property values. The order of *\<xccdf:Group\>* and
*\<xccdf:Rule\>* child elements matters for the appearance of a
generated document, so *\<xccdf:Group\>* and *\<xccdf:Rule\>* child
elements may be freely intermingled. All other child elements must
appear in the order shown in Table 4, and multiple instances of a child
element must be adjacent.

## Item Elements

### Properties

Table 5 describes the properties common to all three classes of items:
*\<xccdf:Group\>*, *\<xccdf:Rule\>*, and *\<xccdf:Value\>* elements.

Each *\<xccdf:conflicts\>* element specifies a single conflicting item using its *\@idref* attribute. If the specified *\<xccdf:Group\>* or *\<xccdf:Rule\>* element is not selected, the requirement is met.
  selected (attribute)   boolean             0-1     If true, this group/rule shall be selected to be processed as part of the *\<xccdf:Benchmark\>* when it is applied to a target system (default: true). An unselected group shall not be processed, and its contents shall NOT be processed either (i.e., all descendants of an unselected group are implicitly unselected). An unselected rule shall not be checked and shall not contribute to scoring. May be overridden by a profile; see Section 6.5.3.
  weight (attribute)     decimal             0-1     The relative scoring weight of this group/rule, for computing a score, expressed as a non-negative real number (0.0 or greater, maximum 3 digits, default 1.0). It denotes the importance of a group/rule. Under some scoring models, scoring is computed independently for each collection of sibling groups and rules, then normalized as part of the overall scoring process. See Section 7.3.2 for more information on scoring. May be overridden by a profile; see Section 6.5.3.

### \<xccdf:Rule\> Element

#### Basics

An *\<xccdf:Rule\>* element defines a single item to be checked as part
of a benchmark, or an extendable base definition for such items. The
*\<xccdf:check\>* child element of an *\<xccdf:Rule\>* specifies how to
verify compliance with a security practice or guideline. See Table 9 and
Section 6.4.4.4 for more information on the *\<xccdf:check\>* element.

The example below shows a very simple *\<xccdf:Rule\>* element.

```xml
<xccdf:Rule id="xccdf_org.example_rule_pwd-perm" selected="1" weight="6.5" severity="high">
  <xccdf:title>Password File Permission</xccdf:title>
  <xccdf:description>Check the access control on the password file.
    Normal users should not be able to write to it.
  </xccdf:description>
  <xccdf:requires idref="xccdf_org.example_rule_passwd-exists"/>
  <xccdf:fixtext>
    Set permissions on the passwd file to owner-write, world-read
  </xccdf:fixtext>
  <xccdf:fix strategy="restrict" reboot="0" disruption="low">
    chmod 644 /etc/passwd
  </xccdf:fix>
  <xccdf:check system="http://oval.mitre.org/XMLSchema/oval-definitions-5">
    <xccdf:check-content-ref href="ovaldefs.xml" name="oval:org.example:def:123"/>
  </xccdf:check>
</xccdf:Rule>
```

One of XCCDF's main features is the organization and selection of
target-applicable groups and rules for performing security and
operational checks on systems. XCCDF can access granular and expressive
mechanisms for assessing the state of a system according to the rule
criteria. Examples of these mechanisms are definitions expressed in the
Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language (OVAL) and questionnaires
expressed in the Open Checklist Interactive Language (OCIL). These
checking mechanisms follow the conceptual model of collecting or
acquiring the state of a target system, and then assessing the state for
conformance to conditions and criteria expressed as rules.

XCCDF may use rule checking systems other than (or in addition to) OVAL
and OCIL. To facilitate this, XCCDF supports referencing by including
the appropriate check content location and check reference in the
*\<xccdf:check\>* element. Rule checking systems are defined separately
from XCCDF itself so that both XCCDF and the rule checking system can
evolve and be used independently. It is helpful for rule checking
mechanisms used by XCCDF to comply with the following:

-   **The mechanism can express both positive and negative criteria.** A
    > positive criterion means that if certain conditions are met, then
    > the system satisfies the check, while a negative criterion means
    > that if the conditions are met, the system fails the check.
    > Experience has shown that both kinds are necessary for checks.

-   **The mechanism can express Boolean combinations of criteria.** It
    > is often impossible to express a high-level security property as a
    > single quantitative or qualitative statement about a system's
    > state. Therefore, the ability to combine statements with 'and' and
    > 'or' is critical.

-   **The mechanism can incorporate tailoring values set by the user.**
    > Value modification is important for XCCDF document tailoring,
    > including substitution of tailored values as well as tailoring of
    > a selected set of rules.

#### \<xccdf:ident\> Elements

Table 10 lists assigned URIs that may appear as the value of the
*\@system* attribute of an *\<xccdf:ident\>* element. If an
identification system included in Table 10 is being specified, the
*\@system* attribute's value SHALL correspond to the appropriate URI in
the table. An author may create a new URI for an identification system
not listed in the table; this URI shall not duplicate any of the Table
10 URI values.

  --------------------------------------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  http://cce.mitre.org                    Common Configuration Enumeration (CCE) -- the identifier value MUST be a CCE version 5 number
  http://cpe.mitre.org                    CPE -- the identifier value MUST be a CPE version 2.0 or 2.3 name
  http://cve.mitre.org                    CVE -- the identifier value MUST be a CVE number
  http://www.cert.org                     CERT Coordination Center -- the identifier value should be a CERT advisory identifier (e.g., "CA-2004-02")
  http://www.kb.cert.org                  US-CERT vulnerability notes database -- the identifier value should be a vulnerability note number (e.g., "709220")
  http://www.us-cert.gov/cas/techalerts   US-CERT technical cyber security alerts -- the identifier value should be a technical cyber security alert ID (e.g., "TA05-189A")

An *\<xccdf:ident\>* element MAY also have additional attributes from
schemas other than the XCCDF schema. Individual organizations and
standards MAY associate specific interpretations of rules based on the
value of an *\<xccdf:ident\>* element and these additional attributes
are allowed in order to refine those interpretations. These additional
attributes MUST NOT alter the processing of a benchmark document as
described in Section 7, although they MAY be added to the output of
Document Generation or displayed to users during processing.

#### \<xccdf:check\> and \<xccdf:complex-check\> Elements

Table 11 shows the possible properties of the *\<xccdf:check\>* element.

In place of an *\<xccdf:check\>* element, XCCDF allows an
*\<xccdf:complex-check\>* element. An *\<xccdf:complex-check\>* is a
boolean logical expression whose individual terms are *\<xccdf:check\>*
and/or *\<xccdf:complex-check\>* elements. This allows benchmark authors
to create more sophisticated checks and to mix checks written with
different checking systems. An *\<xccdf:Rule\>* may have at most one
*\<xccdf:complex-check\>* element; on inheritance, the extending rule's
*\<xccdf:complex-check\>* shall replace the extended rule's
*\<xccdf:complex-check\>*. A benchmark consumer processing a benchmark
picks at most one *\<xccdf:check\>* or *\<xccdf:complex-check\>* element
to process for each rule. If both *\<xccdf:check\>* elements and an
*\<xccdf:complex-check\>* element appear in a rule, then the
*\<xccdf:check\>* elements will be ignored. See Section 7.2.3.5 for
additional information on check processing.

When an *\<xccdf:check\>* element is used with an
*\<xccdf:complex-check\>* element, the *\<xccdf:check\>* element's
*\@multi-check* attribute MUST be ignored.

Operators that may be used to combine the constituents of an
*\<xccdf:complex-check\>* are AND and OR. Truth tables that must be used
when evaluating these operators appear in Table 12 (AND) and Table 13
(OR). Each *\<xccdf:complex-check\>* may also specify that the
expression should be negated (NOT); see Table 14 for the corresponding
truth table. All of the abbreviations in the truth tables come from the
description of the *\<xccdf:rule-result\>* element (see Table 26 in
Section 6.6.4.2 for definitions of each abbreviation).

With an "AND" operator, the *\<xccdf:complex-check\>* evaluates to Pass
only if all of its enclosed terms (*\<xccdf:check\>* and
*\<xccdf:complex-check\>* elements) evaluate to Pass. Table 12 shows the
truth table for "AND".

  I            P   F   U   E   N   K   S   I

The "OR" operator evaluates to Pass if any of its enclosed terms
evaluate to Pass. The truth table for "OR" is shown in Table 13.

  I           P   F   U   E   N   K   S   I

If the *\@negate* attribute is set to true, then the result of the
*\<xccdf:complex-check\>* is complemented (inverted). The full truth
table for negation is listed in Table 14.

#### \<xccdf:fixtext\> and \<xccdf:fix\> Elements

The *\<xccdf:fixtext\>* and *\<xccdf:fix\>* elements help tools support
sophisticated facilities for automated and interactive remediation of
benchmark findings. Table 15 lists the possible properties of an
*\<xccdf:fixtext\>* element.

  sub (element)            identifier   0-n     Specifies an *\<xccdf:Value\>* or *\<xccdf:plain-text\>* substitution. See Section 6.2.9.
  instance (element)       string               Designates a spot where the name of the instance should be substituted into the fix template to generate the final fix data. If the *\@context* attribute is omitted, the value of the context shall default to "undefined".
  id (attribute)           identifier   0-1     A local identifier for the element. It is optional for the id to be unique; multiple *\<xccdf:fix\>* elements may have the same id but different values for their other attributes.
  reboot (attribute)       boolean      0-1     Whether or not remediation will require a reboot or hard reset of the target. Permitted values: true (1) and false (0) (default: 0).
  strategy (attribute)     string       0-1     The method or approach for fixing the problem. See Table 15 for the list of possible values.
  disruption (attribute)   string       0-1     An estimate of the potential for disruption or operational degradation that the application of this fix will impose on the target. See Table 15 for the list of possible values.
  complexity (attribute)   string       0-1     The estimated complexity or difficulty of applying the fix to the target. See Table 15 for the list of possible values.
  system (attribute)       URI          0-1     A URI that identifies the scheme, language, engine, or process for which the fix contents are written. Table 17 defines several general-purpose URNs that may be used for this, and tool vendors and system providers may define and use target-specific URNs.
  platform (attribute)     URI          0-1     In case different fix scripts or procedures are required for different target platform types (e.g., different patches for Windows Vista and Windows 7), this attribute allows a CPE name or CPE applicability language expression to be associated with an *\<xccdf:fix\>* element. This should appear on an *\<xccdf:fix\>* when the content applies to only one platform out of several to which the rule could apply.

Table 17 lists predefined values for the *\@system* attribute of an
*\<xccdf:fix\>* element.

### \<xccdf:Value\> Element

#### Basics

An *\<xccdf:Value\>* is a named parameter (with a unique *\@id*
attribute) that can be substituted into properties of other elements
within the benchmark, including the interior of structured check
specifications and fix scripts. An *\<xccdf:Value\>* can hold string,
boolean, or numeric content, or lists thereof. *\<xccdf:Value\>*
elements can include information about permissible values, display
defaults, and restrictions on tailoring for the Value. For example, an
*\<xccdf:Value\>* might be used to hold a benchmark's lower limit for
password length on some OS. In a profile for that OS to be used in a
closed lab, the default value might be 8, but in a profile for that OS
to be used on the Internet, the default value might be 12.

The example below shows an *\<xccdf:Value\>* element.

```xml
<xccdf:Value id="xccdf_org.example_value_web-server-port" type="number" operator="equals">
  <xccdf:title>Web Server Port</xccdf:title>
  <xccdf:description>
    TCP port on which the server listens
  </xccdf:description>
  <xccdf:value>12080</xccdf:value>
  <xccdf:default>80</xccdf:default>
  <xccdf:lower-bound>0</xccdf:lower-bound>
  <xccdf:upper-bound>65535</xccdf:upper-bound>
</xccdf:Value>
```

*\<xccdf:Value\>* elements may encapsulate values that are lists
(possibly zero-length) of simple types. These structures are supported
by the *\<xccdf:complex-value\>* element, the
*\<xccdf:complex-default\>* element, and within the *\<xccdf:choices\>*
element, the *\<xccdf:complex-choice\>* element. If any of these
elements has no child elements, it represents an empty list.

A single *\<xccdf:Value\>* may use a mixture of both simple (i.e., a
single number, string, or boolean value) and complex types. Apart from
its ability to encapsulate different types of information, a complex
field is used in the same way as its simple counterpart.

#### Properties

Table 18 describes the *\<xccdf:Value\>* element's properties (in
addition to the core item properties previously described in Table 5).

#### \<xccdf:choices\> Element

The *\<xccdf:choices\>* element SHOULD be used when there are a moderate
number of known values that are most appropriate. For example, if the
Value were the authentication mode for a server, the choices might be
"password" and "pki". Table 19 lists the possible properties for an
*\<xccdf:choices\>* element. If a product presents the choice values
from an *\<xccdf:choices\>* element to a user, they SHOULD be presented
in the order in which they appear.

[]{#_Ref295984487 .anchor}Table : Possible Properties for
\<xccdf:choices\> Element

  Property                   Type        Count   Description
  -------------------------- ----------- ------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  choice (element)           string      1-n     The text of a possible choice.
  complex-choice (element)   *special*           A possible choice consisting of a list of values. If this element has no *\<xccdf:item\>* children, it SHALL represent an empty list.
  mustMatch (attribute)      boolean     0-1     If this is true, the list shall represent all the legal values. If this is false or absent, the list shall represent suggested values, and other values may also be legal (subject to the parent *\<xccdf:Value\>* element's *\@upper-bound*, *\@lower-bound*, and *\@match* attributes).
  selector (attribute)       string      0-1     Used for tailoring via a profile. See Section 6.4.5.5.

#### @operator Attribute

When defining an *\<xccdf:Value\>* element, the benchmark author may
specify the operator to be used for comparing the Value to a
configuration during rule checking. For example, one part of an OS
benchmark might be verifying that the configuration included a minimum
password length; the *\<xccdf:Value\>* element that holds the tailorable
minimum could have *\@type* "number" and *\@operator* "greater than".
Exactly how *\<xccdf:Value\>* elements are used in rules depends on the
capabilities of the checking system. Benchmark consumers may ignore the
*\@operator* attribute; therefore, authors should include sufficient
information in the *\<xccdf:description\>* and *\<xccdf:question\>*
elements to make the role of the Value clear. Table 20 describes the
*\@operator* values permitted for each *\@type* value.

[]{#_Ref294717389 .anchor}Table : Permitted Operators by Value Type

  Value Type   Available Operators
  ------------ -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  number       equals, not equal, less than, greater than, less than or equal, greater than or equal (default: equals)
  boolean      equals, not equal (default: equals)
  string       equals, not equal, pattern match (pattern match means regular expression match; should comply with \[UNICODE\]) (default: equals)
  lists        as component data type

#### \@selector Attribute

As detailed in Table 18, an *\<xccdf:Value\>* may include various
elements that constrain or limit the values that the Value may be given.
Authors may use these elements to assist users in tailoring the
benchmark. These elements all support the *\@selector* attribute. If
there are multiple instances of one of these elements within a single
*\<xccdf:Value\>* element, no more than one of the instances may omit
the *\@selector* attribute, and every other instance must have a
different value specified for its *\@selector* attribute. For elements
that may be substituted for each other---specifically, *\<xccdf:value\>*
and *\<xccdf:complex-value\>* elements, and *\<xccdf:default\>* and
*\<xccdf:complex-default\>* elements---no more than one instance of
either element may omit the *\@selector* attribute, and every other
instance of both elements must have a different value specified for its
*\@selector* attribute. For more information about selector types, see
Section 6.5.3.

In the absence of any profile or tailoring actions, the default
*\<xccdf:value\>* or *\<xccdf:complex-value\>* element in an
*\<xccdf:Value\>* shall be the one with an empty or absent *\@selector*.
If there is no *\<xccdf:value\>* or *\<xccdf:complex-value\>* element
with an empty or absent *\@selector*, the first *\<xccdf:value\>* or
*\<xccdf:complex-value\>* element in top-down processing of the XML
shall be the default element. For all other selectable *\<xccdf:Value\>*
elements (i.e., *\<xccdf:default\>, \<xccdf:complex-default\>,
\<xccdf:match\>*, *\<xccdf:upper-bound\>, \<xccdf:lower-bound\>*, and
*\<xccdf:choices\>*), the default activity shall be to ignore all
elements without an empty or absent *\@selector*.

## \<xccdf:Profile\> Element

### Basics

An *\<xccdf:Profile\>* element is a named tailoring for a benchmark.
While a benchmark can be tailored in place by setting properties of
various elements, *\<xccdf:Profile\>* elements allow one benchmark
document to hold several independent tailorings. The *\<xccdf:select\>*
element children of the *\<xccdf:Profile\>* affect which
*\<xccdf:Group\>* and *\<xccdf:Rule\>* elements are selected for
processing when the *\<xccdf:Profile\>* is in effect. The
*\<xccdf:refine-rule\>* element allows modification of properties in
*\<xccdf:Group\>* and *\<xccdf:Rule\>* elements, while the
*\<xccdf:refine-value\>* element allows modification of
*\<xccdf:Value\>* properties, including selection of the effective
value. Finally, *\<xccdf:set-value\>* and *\<xccdf:set-complex-value\>*
allow an *\<xccdf:Value\>* element\'s value to be set directly to a
simple or complex setting, respectively. The example below shows a
simple *\<xccdf:Profile\>*.

```xml
<xccdf:Profile id="xccdf_org.example_profile_strict" prohibitChanges="1" extends="xccdf_org.example_profile_lenient" note-tag="strict-tag">
  <xccdf:title>Strict Security Settings</xccdf:title>
  <xccdf:description>
    Strict lockdown rules and values, for hosts deployed to high-risk environments.
  </xccdf:description>
  <xccdf:set-value idref="xccdf_org.example_value_password-len">10</xccdf:set-value>
  <xccdf:refine-value idref="xccdf_org.example_value_session-timeout" selector="quick"/>
  <xccdf:refine-rule idref="xccdf_org.example_value_session-auth-rule" selector="harsh"/>
  <xccdf:select idref="xccdf_org.example_value_password-len-rule" selected="1"/>
  <xccdf:select idref="xccdf_org.example_value_audit-cluster" selected="1"/>
  <xccdf:select idref="xccdf_org.example_value_telnet-disabled-rule" selected="1"/>
  <xccdf:select idref="xccdf_org.example_value_telnet-settings-cluster" selected="0"/>
</xccdf:Profile>
```

An *\<xccdf:Profile\>* MAY extend another *\<xccdf:Profile\>* in the
same benchmark by using the *\@extends* attribute. An
*\<xccdf:Profile\>* in an *\<xccdf:Tailoring\>* element MAY extend any
*\<xccdf:Profile\>* in a benchmark, but *\<xccdf:Profile\>* elements in
an *\<xccdf:Tailoring\>* element SHALL NOT be extended.

Certain properties of the extended *\<xccdf:Profile\>* appear before the
corresponding properties in the extending *\<xccdf:Profile\>*. Since
*\<xccdf:Profile\>* properties are processed in the order in which they
appear in the XML, this means that properties of the extending
*\<xccdf:Profile\>* can override corresponding properties inherited from
the extended *\<xccdf:Profile\>*. See Sections 7.2.2 and 7.2.3.4 for
additional information on extension and inheritance.

The example below illustrates how selectors work with the
*\<xccdf:refine-value\>* element. See Section 6.4.5.5 for more
information on the *\@selector* attribute. In the example, before the
*\<xccdf:refine-value\>* is applied, the effective value is 8 and the
effective lower bound is 8. (These are the two properties that have no
selectors and are therefore the default.) After the
*\<xccdf:refine-value\>* is applied, the effective value is 14 and the
effective lower bound is 12.

```xml
<xccdf:Value id="xccdf_org.example_value_pw-length" type="number" operator="equals">
  <xccdf:title>Minimum password length policy</xccdf:title>
  <xccdf:value>8</xccdf:value>
  <xccdf:value selector="high">14</xccdf:value>
  <xccdf:lower-bound>8</xccdf:lower-bound>
  <xccdf:lower-bound selector="high">12</xccdf:lower-bound>
</xccdf:Value>
  <xccdf:Profile id="xccdf_org.example_profile_enterprise-internet">
  <xccdf:title>Enterprise internet server profile</xccdf:title>
  <xccdf:refine-value idref="xccdf_org.example_value_pw-length" selector="high"/>
</xccdf:Profile>
```

## \<xccdf:TestResult\> Element

### Basics

An *\<xccdf:TestResult\>* element encapsulates the results of a single
application of a benchmark to a single target platform. The
*\<xccdf:TestResult\>* element normally appears as the child of the
*\<xccdf:Benchmark\>* element, although it may also appear as the
top-level element of an XCCDF results document. XCCDF is not intended to
be a database format for detailed results; the *\<xccdf:TestResult\>*
element offers a way to store the results of individual tests in modest
detail, with the ability to reference lower-level testing data.

Benchmark consumers should include mechanisms so that
*\<xccdf:TestResult\>* elements can retain their context even if
separated from their source benchmark since the *\<xccdf:TestResult\>*
only has meaning relative to the Rules that produced it. There are
several ways to preserve this context, including making sure that the
*\<xccdf:benchmark\>* element in the *\<xccdf:TestResult\>* is a
persistent link to the specific document and version of the benchmark
that produced the result, filling in the relevant version, organization,
and similar fields, and/or using descriptive metadata. This document
does not mandate any specific approach, but benchmark consumers should
ensure some mechanism is in place to avoid context loss.

The example below shows an *\<xccdf:TestResult\>* element with a few
*\<xccdf:rule-result\>* children.

### Properties

Table 23 describes the *\<xccdf:TestResult\>* element's properties.
Although several of its child elements technically support the
*\@override* attribute (discussed in Section 6.3.1), the
*\<xccdf:TestResult\>* element cannot be extended. Therefore,
*\@override* has no meaning within an *\<xccdf:TestResult\>* element and
its children, and it should not be used for them.

Properties

  Property                      Type         Count   Description
  ----------------------------- ------------ ------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  benchmark (element)           *special*    0-1     Reference to the *\<xccdf:Benchmark\>* for which the *\<xccdf:TestResult\>* records results. Required if this *\<xccdf:TestResult\>* element is the top-level element, optional otherwise. The required *\@href* attribute gives the URI of the benchmark document, and the optional *\@id* attribute holds the value of that *\<xccdf:Benchmark\>* element\'s *\@id* attribute.
  tailoring-file (element)      *special*    0-1     Holds identifying information about an *\<xccdf:Tailoring\>* element. See Section 6.6.5.
  title (element)               string       0-n     Title of the test. It may have an *\@xml:lang* attribute (see Section 6.2.10).
  remark (element)              string       0-n     A remark about the test, possibly supplied by the person administering the benchmark assessment. It may have an *\@xml:lang* attribute (see Section 6.2.10).
  organization (element)        string       0-n     The name of the organization or other entity responsible for applying this benchmark and generating this result. When multiple organization elements are used to indicate multiple organization names in a hierarchical organization, the highest-level organization should appear first (e.g., "U.S. Government") followed by subordinate organizations (e.g., "Department of Defense").
  identity (element)            string       0-1     Information about the system identity or user employed during application of the benchmark. If used, Shall specify the name of the authenticated identity. Has required boolean attributes that specify whether the identity was authenticated with the target system during the application of the benchmark *(\@authenticated)*, and whether the identity was granted administrative or other special privileges beyond those of a normal user *(\@privileged)*.
  profile (element)             identifier   0-1     The identifier of the *\<xccdf:Profile\>* used for the test. If the *\<xccdf:TestResult\>* element contains an *\<xccdf:tailoring-file\>* element, then this SHALL be the identifier of the associated tailoring profile. Otherwise, if there is no *\<xccdf:tailoring-file\>* element present, this SHALL be the identifier of the associated benchmark profile if a profile was applied, and it SHALL be absent if no profile was applied. See Section 6.6.5.
  target (element)              string       1-n     Name or description of the target system whose test results are recorded in the *\<xccdf:TestResult\>* element (the system to which a benchmark test was applied). Each appearance of the element supplies a name by which the target host or device was identified at the time the test was run. The name may be any string, but applications should include the fully qualified DNS name whenever possible.
  target-address (element)      string       0-n     Network address of the target system to which a benchmark test was applied. Typical forms for the address include IP version 4 (IPv4), IP version 6 (IPv6), and Ethernet media access control (MAC).
  target-facts (element)        string       0-1     A list of named facts about the target system or platform. Each *\<xccdf:fact\>* in the list shall specify the value of the fact itself. Each *\<xccdf:fact\>* SHALL have a *\@name* attribute (URI) and may include a *\@type* attribute ("string", "number", or "boolean") (default: "boolean"). Pre-defined *\@name* attribute values are listed in Table 24; product developers may define additional platform-specific and product-specific facts.
  target-id-ref (element)       *special*    0-n     Used to reference target identification information located in an external document. The assessment target MAY be identified using other identification schemas such as Asset Identification (see \[IR7693\] for additional information). Each instance of this element identifies the same target of this report (multiple identifiers for a single target). Inclusion of an *\<xccdf:target-id-ref\>* element does not remove the requirement to identify the target using the *\<xccdf:target\>* element.
  any                                                Arbitrary contents, namespace="\#\#other". This is for other target identification structures, such as those defined in the Asset Identification schema (see \[IR7693\]). Inclusion of an identifying element does not remove the requirement to identify the target using the *\<xccdf:target\>* element.
  platform (element)            string       0-n     The platforms that the target system was found to meet. See Section 6.2.5.
  set-value (element)           string       0-n     Specific setting for a single *\<xccdf:Value\>* element used during the test.
  set-complex-value (element)   *special*            Specific setting for a single *\<xccdf:Value\>* element used during the test when the given value is set to a complex type, such as a list.
  rule-result (element)         *special*    0-n     The result of a single instance of a rule application against the target. The *\<xccdf:TestResult\>* must include one *\<xccdf:rule-result\>* record for each *\<xccdf:Rule\>* that was selected in the resolved benchmark; it may also include *\<xccdf:rule-result\>* records for *\<xccdf:Rule\>* elements that were unselected in the benchmark. See Section 6.6.4.
  score (element)               decimal      1-n     An overall score for this benchmark test. The optional *\@system* attribute identifies the URI for a scoring model (see Section 7.3.2 for more information on pre-defined models). The optional *\@maximum* attribute specifies the maximum possible value of the score.
  metadata (element)            *special*    0-n     XML metadata associated with this *\<xccdf:TestResult\>*. For example, this element can hold a copy of the *\<xccdf:metadata\>* element of the *\<xccdf:Benchmark\>* which served as the source for these results. This is especially useful if the *\<xccdf:TestResult\>* will be separated from its source benchmark because the publication and support information in the benchmark can travel with the *\<xccdf:TestResult\>*. Benchmark consumers may also add their own metadata to *\<xccdf:TestResult\>* elements they produce. See Section 6.2.3.
  signature (element)           *special*    0-1     A digital signature asserting authorship and allowing verification of the integrity of the *\<xccdf:TestResult\>*. See Section 6.2.7.
  id (attribute)                *special*    1       Unique identifier for this element; see Section 6.2.3.
  start-time (attribute)        dateTime     0-1     Time when test began.
  end-time (attribute)          dateTime     1       Time when test was completed and the results recorded.
  test-system (attribute)       string       0-1     Name of the benchmark consumer program that generated this *\<xccdf:TestResult\>* element; should be either a CPE name or a CPE applicability language expression.
  version (attribute)           string       0-1     The version number string copied from the *\<xccdf:Benchmark\>*.
  Id (attribute)                *special*    0-1     An identifier used for referencing elements included in an XML signature. See Section 6.2.7.

### \<xccdf:fact\> Element

The URIs listed in Table 24 should be used, when applicable to the
target, to record facts about the IT asset to which an

#### \<xccdf:result\> Element

Table 26 lists the possible results of a single test (assigned to the
*\<xccdf:result\>* element).

[]{#_Ref294717545 .anchor}Table : Possible Results for a Single Test

  **Result and Abbreviation**   **Description**
  ----------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  pass \[P\]                    The target system or system component satisfied all the conditions of the *\<xccdf:Rule\>*.
  fail \[F\]                    The target system or system component did not satisfy all the conditions of the *\<xccdf:Rule\>*.
  error \[E\]                   The checking engine could not complete the evaluation, therefore the status of the target's compliance with the *\<xccdf:Rule\>* is not certain. This could happen, for example, if a testing tool was run with insufficient privileges and could not gather all of the necessary information.
  unknown \[U\]                 The testing tool encountered some problem and the result is unknown. For example, a result of 'unknown' might be given if the testing tool was unable to interpret the output of the checking engine (the output has no meaning to the testing tool).
  notapplicable \[N\]           The *\<xccdf:Rule\>* was not applicable to the target of the test. For example, the *\<xccdf:Rule\>* might have been specific to a different version of the target OS, or it might have been a test against a platform feature that was not installed.
  notchecked \[K\]              The *\<xccdf:Rule\>* was not evaluated by the checking engine. This status is designed for *\<xccdf:Rule\>* elements that have no *\<xccdf:check\>* elements or that correspond to an unsupported checking system. It may also correspond to a status returned by a checking engine if the checking engine does not support the indicated check code.
  notselected \[S\]             The *\<xccdf:Rule\>* was not selected in the benchmark.
  informational \[I\]           The *\<xccdf:Rule\>* was checked, but the output from the checking engine is simply information for auditors or administrators; it is not a compliance category. This status value is designed for *\<xccdf:Rule\>* elements whose main purpose is to extract information from the target rather than test the target.
  fixed \[X\]                   The *\<xccdf:Rule\>* had failed, but was then fixed (possibly by a tool that can automatically apply remediation, or possibly by the human auditor).

#### \<xccdf:override\> Element

The *\<xccdf:override\>* element provides a mechanism for an auditor to
change the result assigned by the checking tool or to document the
reason for deviation from the rule requirement. This is necessary when
checking a rule requires reviewing manual procedures or other non-IT
conditions, and/or when a check gives an inaccurate result on a
particular target system. The *\<xccdf:override\>* element shall contain
the properties listed in Table 27. Note that the *\<xccdf:override\>*
element is unrelated to the *\@override* attribute (Section 6.3.1). If
the *\<xccdf:override\>* element is present, the *\<xccdf:result\>*
element SHALL be changed to match the *\<xccdf:override\>* element\'s
*\<xccdf:new-result\>* property.

The example below shows how an *\<xccdf:override\>* element would appear
in an *\<xccdf:rule-result\>.* Note: if an *\<xccdf:override\>* element
is added to an *\<xccdf:rule-result\>* that was previously signed, it
will break any XML digital signature applied to the enclosing
*\<xccdf:TestResult\>* element.

### \<xccdf:tailoring-file\> Element

The *\<xccdf:tailoring-file\>* element in the *\<xccdf:TestResult\>*
element is used to provide information about an *\<xccdf:Tailoring\>*
element. Table 28 shows the properties of an *\<xccdf:tailoring-file\>*
element. The *\<xccdf:tailoring-file\>* element MUST be present if and
only if one of the *\<xccdf:Profile\>* elements of the
*\<xccdf:Tailoring\>* element was applied or created during the
activities that created the given *\<xccdf:TestResult\>* element.
"Applied" refers to applying a profile during benchmark profile
processing, while "created" refers to a user's manual tailoring actions
resulting in the generation of a new *\<xccdf:Tailoring\>* element. (See
Section 6.7 for information on *\<xccdf:Tailoring\>*.)

## \<xccdf:Tailoring\> Element

### Basics

An *\<xccdf:Tailoring\>* element allows named tailorings (i.e.,
profiles) of a benchmark to be defined separately from the benchmark
itself. There are several reasons why this might be desirable:

-   The benchmark might not be controlled by the organization wishing to
    add the profile to it.

-   The benchmark might have digital signatures that would be corrupted
    by benchmark modification.

-   The benchmark might undergo revision by its author, so modifications
    by a different party would represent a development fork that
    complicates maintenance.

-   It enables the capturing of manual tailoring actions in a
    well-defined format (see Section 5.2).

The profiles in an *\<xccdf:Tailoring\>* element can be used in two
ways. First, an organization might wish to pre-define a set of tailoring
actions to be applied on top of or instead of the tailoring performed by
a benchmark\'s profiles. This may be necessary to adjust the benchmark
to the local needs of an enterprise. By creating new *\<xccdf:Profile\>*
elements with these tailorings and saving them in the
*\<xccdf:Tailoring\>* element, these can be applied to future
assessments. The *\<xccdf:Tailoring\>* elements also serve as records of
these additional tailoring actions, providing the context needed to
interpret *\<xccdf:TestResult\>* elements.

In addition, an *\<xccdf:Tailoring\>* element can be used to to record
manual tailoring actions performed during the course of an assessment.
Manual tailoring actions SHOULD be limited to actions that could be
performed using selectors in an *\<xccdf:Profile\>* element. If this is
done, any manual tailoring action can be recorded in a series of
selectors in a newly defined *\<xccdf:Profile\>* element. By storing
this *\<xccdf:Profile\>* in an *\<xccdf:Tailoring\>* element, the
processes that led to a particular set of *\<xccdf:TestResult\>*
elements can be saved for future reference. Of course, such an
*\<xccdf:Tailoring\>* element could then be used as input to subsequent
assessments.

### Properties

An *\<xccdf:Tailoring\>* element holds one or more *\<xccdf:Profile\>*
elements. These *\<xccdf:Profile\>* elements record additional tailoring
activities that apply to a given *\<xccdf:Benchmark\>*.
*\<xccdf:Tailoring\>* elements are separate from benchmark documents,
but each *\<xccdf:Tailoring\>* element is associated with a specific
benchmark document. By defining these tailoring actions separately from
the benchmark document to which they apply, these actions can be
recorded without affecting the integrity of the source itself.

Table 29 lists the possible properties for the *\<xccdf:Tailoring\>*
element.

[]{#_Ref298931237 .anchor}Table : \<xccdf:Tailoring\> Element Properties

  --------------------- ----------- ------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Property              Type        Count   Description
  benchmark (element)   *special*   0-1     Identifies the Benchmark to which this tailoring applies. A tailoring document is only applicable to a single Benchmark. The *\<xccdf:benchmark\>* element holds the associated Benchmark\'s location URI, version string, and id value. Note, however, that this is a purely informative field. Benchmark consumers are not required to perform any lookup or even verify that a tailoring document is being applied to the correct Benchmark.
  status (element)      *special*   0-n     Status of the tailoring and date at which it attained that status. Authors MAY use this element to record the maturity or consensus level of a tailoring. See Section 6.2.8.
  dc-status (element)   *special*   0-n     Holds additional status information using the Dublin Core format. See Section 6.2.8.
  version (element)     *special*   1       The version of this tailoring, with a REQUIRED *\@time* attribute (when it was created). This is necessary because, under some circumstances, a copy of a tailoring document might be automatically generated. Without the version and timestamp, tracking of these automatically created tailoring documents could become problematic.
  metadata (element)    *special*   0-n     XML metadata for the tailoring. See Section 6.2.4.
  Profile (element)     Profile     1-n     Profiles that reference and customize sets of items in a Benchmark; see Section 6.5. These elements are identical to Profiles that might be found in a normal Benchmark. Moreover, they can extend the Profiles in the tailoring document\'s associated Benchmark using normal Profile extension mechanics. However, Profiles in the tailoring document cannot themselves be extended. For this reason, no Profile in the tailoring document should have its abstract property set to \"true\".
  signature (element)   *special*   0-1     A digital signature asserting authorship and allowing verification of the integrity of the tailoring. See Section 6.2.7.
  id (attribute)        *special*   1       Unique identifier for this element. See Section 6.2.3.
  Id (attribute)        *special*   0-1     An identifier used for referencing elements included in an XML signature. See Section 6.2.7.
  --------------------- ----------- ------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Profile Shadowing

Profiles in an *\<xccdf:Tailoring\>* element MAY "shadow" profiles in
the associated benchmark document. When a tailoring profile shadows a
benchmark profile, it assumes the identifier of that profile in all
subsequent processing, and the shadowed benchmark profile effectively
becomes invisible. Shadowing occurs when the tailoring profile\'s *\@id*
AND *\@extends* attributes are both identical to the *\@id* attribute of
the benchmark profile. Note that a tailoring profile MAY extend a
benchmark profile without shadowing it; the tailoring profile would
simply use an identifier different from the identifier of the benchmark
profile. However, a tailoring profile\'s *\@id* attribute SHALL NOT
duplicate a benchmark profile\'s id unless the tailoring profile is
extending the benchmark profile.

Table 30 summarizes this behavior. In this table, consider an
*\<xccdf:Tailoring\>* element with a single *\<xccdf:Profile\>* whose
*\@id* and *\@extends* attributes have the given values. This
*\<xccdf:Tailoring\>* element is associated with an
*\<xccdf:Benchmark\>* that likewise has an *\<xccdf:Profile\>* whose
*\@id* attribute has the given value.

  B            A                   A          The tailoring profile extends but does not shadow the benchmark profile. If profile \"A\" is applied, it is the benchmark profile of that name that is applied. If profile \"B\" is applied, it is the tailoring profile of that name that is applied.

  A            B                   A          An error is thrown during processing: the tailoring profile identifier duplicates the identifier of a benchmark profile without extending that profile.

### Tailoring Actions and Profile Selectors

As mentioned earlier, a tailoring profile can be used to record manual
tailoring actions and to serve as a record of these actions when
evaluating a given *\<xccdf:TestResult\>*. In such a case, the following
user tailoring actions are represented by the profile selectors
designated in Table 31.
